## Acknowledgments
I am proud to acknowledge my successful completion of the Frontend Mentor challenge for the PROFILE CARD COMPONENT using HTML and CSS. This project not only enhanced my technical skills in web development but also deepened my understanding of responsive design and user interface principles. By meticulously translating the design specifications into functional code, I gained valuable experience in structuring and styling components effectively. This challenge has further fueled my passion for frontend development and has inspired me to tackle more complex projects in the future.
